## Neural Random Subspace (NRS), 3D Part

This repo includes the content that we use to verify the effectiveness of NRS (Neural Random Subspace) on 3D Point Cloud Recognition Task.
It is based on the following implementations:

- https://github.com/WangYueFt/dgcnn
- https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch


Major baselines we use include [PointNet](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Qi_PointNet_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) 
, [PointNet++](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7095-pointnet-deep-hierarchical-feature-learning-on-point-sets-in-a-metric-space.pdf) 
and [DGCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07829) (optional).

We'd love you to cite our work if you find it is helpful :)
